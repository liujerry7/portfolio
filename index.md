## Projects
# Dual Axis Solar Tracker
![Solar Tracker](solartracker.jpg)
I made a dual axis solar tracker using Arduino components. Our team 3D printed a cross to use shadows as a way to track light by placing four photodiodes in each section of the cross. If the difference in light received from the photodiodes exceeds a threshold, the horizontal axis or vertical axis servo would spin in the appropriate direction. I specifically worked on power optimization. Instead of incrementing the servo movement 3 degrees every loop, I changed the code to move proportional to the difference in light. The farther the solar tracker was from light, the farther the solar tracker would move.
