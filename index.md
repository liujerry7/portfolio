I am a sophomore majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in entrepreneurship at the University of Michigan. Some of my previous projects were related to robotics, embedded systems, and machine learning. I am currently interested in studying embedded systems, but I am also eager to learn more about almost anything. :grin:

### Dual Axis Solar Tracker Fall 2017

I made a dual axis solar tracker using Arduino components. Our team 3D printed a cross to use shadows as a way to track light by placing four photodiodes in each section of the cross. If the difference in light received from the photodiodes exceeds a threshold, the horizontal axis or vertical axis servo would spin in the appropriate direction. I specifically worked on power optimization. Instead of incrementing the servo movement 3 degrees every loop, I changed the code to move proportional to the difference in light. The farther the solar tracker was from light, the farther the solar tracker would move.

### 3D Printed Phone Case Startup Spring 2017

For my entrepreneurship class project, we were encouraged to use simple everyday materials to create a product or service to sell. With limited materials, I had the idea of 3D printing a simple, sellable product. We named our startup CAS3D, and we began designing our own phone cases on Autodesk Fusion 360. Our business pitch was selling customizable, low price, and 3D printed phone cases. I experimented with the durability of the phone case by extruding material to make it more flexible. I messed around with different designs and colors. For example, below is a link to my GrabCAD account where I designed a two piece phone case that could act as a phone stand as well. I stopped the phone case venture after analyzing our profit margin. Since we were using the school's provided 3D printer, we could only print a few phone cases a day. Our max profit per day was around $10 since we sold each phone case at $5. Margin for expansion was also limited. My grabcad account:
